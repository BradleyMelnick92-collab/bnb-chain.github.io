One major part of the entire project that I had in mind was bridging crypto wallets and apps and expanding crypto to be a more widely used source of income and spending and creating , investing in other creating their own tokens and crypto ,  yes even meme coins because at the end me or the day crypto just makes more sense than gold and oil ,   in the near future I hope crypto is universal around then world and everyone has a crypto wallet that never runs dry .   internet money ,  digital money .   everyone should know what it's like to have their bills paid and not have to struggle to make ends meet .   the base idea of godmode was to use crypto and dapps to just start helping people in Meed.     it was a simple idea from a simple man and now it is beyond what I could have imagined .  thank you 

I still have to create a crypto token myself to go alone with the app and web page 
the Bit 0fH0pe token B0H .   I have been testing wallets and working non bridging them and various other tokens 
and trying to understand a lot and do what seemed like a few small tasks but they have definitely been tedious and time consuming
